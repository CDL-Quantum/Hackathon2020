# Solutions for Hackathon 2020

We attempted two problems from two different hardware providers as part of this hackathon.

As part of the DWave challenge, we attempted to find an efficient way of generating volunteer food delivery routes for food banks, serving the less fortunate segments of the society, using a modified version of the Multiple Travelling Salesman problem and DWave Leap Hybrid Solver.

As part of the IBM Challenge, we attempted the Galaxy classification with FRQI utilizing Quantum Image Classification.
