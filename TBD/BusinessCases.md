## Motivation

As part of the IBM Challenge, our goal was not just to tackle the QIMP problem but also propose potential applications and further researches.

## Business Applications and Potential Research


## Business Cases

1. ![Airbus](https://www.airbus.com/innovation/industry-4-0/quantum-technologies.html) is interested in the QIMP for sorting and analyzing images 
streamed by satellites. Thus, QIMP can be applied to classify satellites images.

2. ![AT&T](https://about.att.com/innovationblog/2018/12/building_a_quantum_network.html) announced that it  builds out its quantum networking technology
for secure communications. AT&T is in a potential need of quantum image processing and encoding.

3. ![Boxcat](http://boxc.at/) leverages the power of quantum computing to render images and videos faster, cheaper, and more efficiently than current methods. 
They are targeting the media and medical imaging industries as potential customers for their solution. Provided one of the first 
experimental result in the very first image being rendered with the support of a quantum computer (D-Wave 2000Q)
