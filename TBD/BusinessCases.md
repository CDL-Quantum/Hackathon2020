## Motivation

As part of the IBM Challenge, our goal was not just to tackle the QIMP problem but also to propose potential applications and further researches.

## Business Applications and Potential Research

Here are a few examples of potential application and further investigations.

1. Mapping out molecules and atoms for the creation of new materials by [applying ML](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b04090) to accelerate material discovery, including the use of active learning to guide experimental design.

2. Modeling molecular interactions at an atomic level, allowing new pharmaceuticals and [medical research.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41570-020-0189-9)
 
3. [NASAâ€™ s QuAIL](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20180001867) discoveries of Stars, Solar systems and Earth-like exoplanets based on data received from Space Probes.  

4. Enchance the patterns of [recognitions and classification.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11326)

5. Examine the potential cataclysmic growth of Big Data and AI when [Quantum Computing](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40537-019-0202-7) becomes another piece of the future jigsaw puzzle for AI and Human Interaction. 

5. Efficient image and video processing encoded in qubits and further securely transmitting through networks protected by quantum technology.

## Business Cases

1. [Airbus](https://www.airbus.com/innovation/industry-4-0/quantum-technologies.html) is interested in the QIMP for sorting and analyzing images 
streamed by satellites. Thus, QIMP can be applied to classify satellites images.

2. [AT&T](https://about.att.com/innovationblog/2018/12/building_a_quantum_network.html) announced that it  builds out its quantum networking technology
for secure communications. AT&T is in a potential need of quantum image processing and encoding.

3. [Boxcat](http://boxc.at/) leverages the power of quantum computing to render images and videos faster, cheaper, and more efficiently than current methods. 
They are targeting the media and medical imaging industries as potential customers for their solution. Provided one of the first 
experimental result in the very first image being rendered with the support of a quantum computer (D-Wave 2000Q)
