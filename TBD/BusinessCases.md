## Motivation

As part of the IBM Challenge, our goal was not just to tackle the QIMP problem but also propose potential applications and further researches.

## Business Applications and Potential Research

Here are a few examples of potential application and further investigations:

1 . Mapping out molecules and atoms for the creation of new materials
Modeling molecular interactions at an atomic level, allowing new pharmaceuticals and medical research[1] https://doi.org/10.1038/s41570-020-0189-9 
 
Space Exploration and the discovery of planets
NASAâ€™ s QuAIL(Quantum artificial intelligence lab) : https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20180001867
Mapping out the human mind https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40537-019-0202-7
More enhanced pattern recognition and classification https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11326
Better understanding of nanoparticles https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b04090
Efficient image and video processing encoded in qubits and further securely transmitting through networks protected by quantum technology

## Business Cases

1. ![Airbus](https://www.airbus.com/innovation/industry-4-0/quantum-technologies.html) is interested in the QIMP for sorting and analyzing images 
streamed by satellites. Thus, QIMP can be applied to classify satellites images.

2. ![AT&T](https://about.att.com/innovationblog/2018/12/building_a_quantum_network.html) announced that it  builds out its quantum networking technology
for secure communications. AT&T is in a potential need of quantum image processing and encoding.

3. ![Boxcat](http://boxc.at/) leverages the power of quantum computing to render images and videos faster, cheaper, and more efficiently than current methods. 
They are targeting the media and medical imaging industries as potential customers for their solution. Provided one of the first 
experimental result in the very first image being rendered with the support of a quantum computer (D-Wave 2000Q)
